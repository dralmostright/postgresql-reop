Monitoring PostgreSQL is essential to maintain performance, prevent issues, and optimize user experience by identifying slow queries. It also ensures high performance, availability, and functional application infrastructure. PostgreSQL has multiple tools and views which we can use for monitoring which some of them come with PostgreSQL while we need to install and configure manually. Additionally we also see how we can use unix tools to monitor them.
