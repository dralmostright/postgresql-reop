## Configuration Files

### postgresql.conf
postgresql.conf is PostgreSQL's main configuration file and the primary source of configuration parameter settings. postgresql.conf is a plain text file generated by initdb and is normally stored in the data directory and my depend upon the platform where the PostgreSQL is installed. This is man file PostgreSQL uses to find configurations when it starts up.

The best way to find is querying the database itself, and you can also use os commands like ```locate``` and ```find``` too.
```
postgres=# show config_file;
              config_file
----------------------------------------
 /var/lib/pgsql/15/data/postgresql.conf
(1 row)

postgres=#
```
The file has lots of configuration parameters related to memory, wal, authentication and many more, which we can customize according to our need. One parameter can be specified on each line as a name/value setting; blank lines will be ignored. Any part of a line following a hash mark (#) will be treated as a comment. White space within a line is not significant, and the equals sign (=) between name and value is optional, provided there is at least one whitespace character separating them. Parameters which include whitespace must be quoted with single quotes. In the rare case that single quotes occur in parameter values, these must be escaped either using two quotes or with a backslash (\').

Excerpt of the sample file.
```
# Comment
port = 5432
ssl on
shared_buffers = 512MB  # very important to get this right!
default_transaction_isolation = 'read committed'
log_line_prefix = '[\'foo''] ' # this log line prefix will be printed as: "['foo'] "
```

#### Making changes to postgresql.conf
postgresql.conf can be altered using any text editor; use of a provisioning system is generally a sensible way of managing this and related files. The PostgreSQL configuration can also modified with the SQL command ALTER SYSTEM (PostgreSQL 9.4 and later). This does not change postgresql.conf directly; instead changes are written to the special file postgresql.auto.conf, which overrides settings in postgresql.conf. 

#### Activating changes
postgresql.conf is read at server startup. Any changes made while the server is running will not be automatically become effective; a SIGHUP signal must be sent, which can be performed with pg_ctl reload or by executing SELECT pg_reload_conf(). Some configuration parameters require that the server is restarted.

Just for demo we will change the timezone parameter.

```
postgres=# \x
Expanded display is on.
postgres=# select * from pg_settings where name ='TimeZone';
-[ RECORD 1 ]---+----------------------------------------------------------------
name            | TimeZone
setting         | Asia/Kathmandu
unit            |
category        | Client Connection Defaults / Locale and Formatting
short_desc      | Sets the time zone for displaying and interpreting time stamps.
extra_desc      |
context         | user
vartype         | string
source          | configuration file
min_val         |
max_val         |
enumvals        |
boot_val        | GMT
reset_val       | Asia/Kathmandu
sourcefile      | /var/lib/pgsql/15/data/postgresql.conf
sourceline      | 713
pending_restart | f

postgres=# select now();
-[ RECORD 1 ]------------------------
now | 2024-02-05 13:04:41.25457+05:45

postgres=#
```

Now lets change the parameter using alter system:
```
postgres=# alter system set timezone = 'UTC-4';
ALTER SYSTEM
postgres=# select now();
-[ RECORD 1 ]-------------------------
now | 2024-02-05 13:07:55.172824+05:45

postgres=#
```
We can see that the value has been changed but not reflected, however this has been updated in ```postgresql.auto.conf``` file.

```
[root@testdb data]# cat postgresql.auto.conf
# Do not edit this file manually!
# It will be overwritten by the ALTER SYSTEM command.
timezone = 'UTC-4'
[root@testdb data]#
```
As discussed in earlier section we can reload the conf using below:
```
postgres=# SELECT pg_reload_conf();
 pg_reload_conf
----------------
 t
(1 row)

postgres=# select now();
              now
-------------------------------
 2024-02-05 11:27:33.589324+04
(1 row)

postgres=#
```

Now we will reload using pg_ctl too. In case if you are not able to fing pg_ctl, there are high chances your environment variables are not properly configured. Hence check if its actually installed or not using below:
```
[postgres@testdb ~]$ rpm -ql postgresql15-server | grep pg_ctl
/usr/pgsql-15/bin/pg_ctl
/usr/pgsql-15/share/man/man1/pg_ctl.1
[postgres@testdb ~]$
```

As we can see its intalled we will just need to make proper enty in environment variables.
Now lets try with pg_ctl reload, it doesn't restarted the database cluster.
```
[postgres@testdb ~]$ pg_ctl reload
server signaled
[postgres@testdb ~]$
```
