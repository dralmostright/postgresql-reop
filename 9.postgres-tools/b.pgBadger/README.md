### pgBadger

pgBadger is a PostgreSQL performance analyzer, built for speed with fully detailed reports based on your PostgreSQL log files. pgBadger is a fast and easy tool to analyze your SQL traffic and create HTML5 reports with dynamics graphs. pgBadger is the perfect tool to understand the behavior of your PostgreSQL servers and identify which SQL queries need to be optimized.

We need to install it as it doesn't get shipped with PostgreSQL binaries. {pgBadger](https://yum.postgresql.org/packages/) is listed in postgresql common repository. Here we will be installing for rhel8 hence we will go for [RHEL8](https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/common/redhat/rhel-8-x86_64/) repo.
